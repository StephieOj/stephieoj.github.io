# My Coding Journey: From Zero to Hero with SheCodes

Hey there, tech enthusiasts! I’m thrilled to share my first-ever blog post as a new coder diving headfirst into the exciting world of programming. I apologise in advance, this is going to be a long one- I wanted to cover everything I've learned so far! 😬

A few months ago, I was a complete beginner, unsure if coding was even for me. I loved the idea of coding but as a Business Analyst by day, I was worried about the transition. Fast forward to today, and I’m building interactive web pages, coding in Python, and even dabbling in AI—all thanks to the SheCodes Bootcamp! I’ve completed SheCodes Basics, SheCodes Plus, and the AI workshop, and I’m currently rocking the Python workshop. Let me take you through my journey, break down what each workshop taught me, and hopefully inspire you to start your own coding adventure!

## Why I Started Coding 🚀

I’ve always been curious about how websites and apps work, but the idea of coding felt intimidating—like it was reserved for tech geniuses. Then I stumbled across SheCodes, a program designed for women like me who want to break into tech with zero experience. Their hands-on, beginner-friendly approach gave me the courage to take the plunge. Now, I’m not just learning to code—I’m loving it. Every line of code feels like a tiny victory, and I’m so proud of how far I’ve come!

### SheCodes Basics: My First Taste of Coding 👩🏼‍💻

SheCodes Basics was my introduction to the coding world, and wow, what a way to start! This three-week workshop is perfect for absolute beginners. It’s 100% online, self-paced, and packed with bite-sized lessons that make learning fun and approachable.

**What I Learned:**
- **HTML:** I built my first web page from scratch, structuring content like headings, paragraphs, and images. It was so cool to see my words come to life in a browser!
- **CSS:** I styled my page with colours, fonts, and layouts, making it look polished and professional.
- **JavaScript:** I added interactivity, like buttons that trigger animations. My final project—a landing page—was a proud moment!

**Key Takeaway:**  
Coding isn’t as scary as it seems! Basics showed me that with clear instructions and hands-on practice, anyone can create something awesome. The supportive SheCodes community and instructor Matt Delac’s engaging teaching style made every challenge feel doable.

### SheCodes Plus: Leveling Up My Front-End Skills 🔥

After Basics, I was hooked and jumped into SheCodes Plus, an eight-week workshop focused on advanced front-end development. This one pushed me to think like a developer, building more complex projects and learning professional tools.

**What I Learned:**
- **Advanced JavaScript (ES6):** I mastered modern JavaScript techniques to create dynamic, interactive features.
- **APIs:** I integrated live data, like weather forecasts, into my projects. My weather app felt like something you’d actually use!
- **Git and GitHub:** I learned version control, which is how real developers manage code and collaborate.
- **Responsive Design:** I made my websites look great on any device, from phones to desktops.

**Key Takeaway:**  
SheCodes Plus showed me the power of combining creativity and logic. Building a world clock and a weather app gave me confidence that I could tackle real-world projects. The weekly homework and professional feedback kept me motivated and on track.

### SheCodes AI Workshop: A Peek into the Future 🤖

The SheCodes Plus AI workshop was a fun bonus that introduced me to artificial intelligence. It’s short but packed with practical skills for integrating AI into coding projects.

**What I Learned:**
- **AI Tools:** I experimented with tools like ChatGPT to generate content and assist with coding tasks.
- **Project Integration:** I added AI-powered features to my web projects, like chatbots and text generators.
- **GitHub and Netlify:** I learned to deploy my AI projects online, which felt like launching my own mini-app!

**Key Takeaway:**  
AI is the future, and it’s surprisingly accessible for beginners. This workshop showed me how to blend AI with coding to create smarter, more engaging applications. It’s a skill that makes you feel like you’re on the cutting edge of tech!

### SheCodes Python Workshop: Unlocking a New Language 🐍

I’m currently working through the SheCodes Python workshop, and it’s been a game-changer. Python is such a versatile language, and this workshop is teaching me how to use it for data manipulation and building interactive applications.

**What I Learned:**
- **Python Fundamentals:** I got comfy with variables, loops, and logical operators—building blocks for coding logic.
- **Data Handling:** I’m learning to process and visualise data, which feels like magic when you see numbers turn into graphs!
- **Interactive Projects:** I built a text generator, which was both challenging and super rewarding.

**Key Takeaway:**  
Python is beginner-friendly but incredibly powerful. The workshop’s hands-on challenges make complex concepts feel approachable, and I’m already dreaming up ideas for my own Python projects. If you’re curious about data or automation, Python is a fantastic place to start!
