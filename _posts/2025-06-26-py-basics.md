# Building My First Weather App with Python Basics! 🚀🐍

Hello, fellow coding enthusiasts! I’m back with a super exciting blog post, fresh from completing the **SheCodes Python Basics workshop!** As a newbie coder working through the [SheCodes Bootcamp](https://www.shecodes.io/workshops#features), I’m over the moon to share how I built my very first interactive weather app with Python. It’s been an amazing journey learning user input, API integration, forecasts, and crafting a fun user interface—and I even earned my Python Basics certificate! 🎉 Let’s dive into the techniques I used, celebrate the wins, and get you excited to try it too! 😄

## My Coding Journey So Far

If you’re new here, I’m Stephie, a beginner coder who’s been soaking up skills through SheCodes. I’ve tackled HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and front-end projects, and now I’m diving deep into Python. Finishing the Python Basics workshop felt so good, especially with this weather app project I can now showcase. It’s been a mix of challenges and triumphs, and I’m loving every second of it—plus, that certificate with my name on it is a badge of honor I’m super proud of! 📜

## Creating My Weather App: The Techniques I Used 🌦️

This week, I put my Python skills to the test by building an interactive weather app. I’ll walk you through the cool techniques that brought it to life, thanks to SheCodes’ awesome lessons.

### What I Learned:
- **User Input**: I used Python’s `input()` function to let users type a city name, making the app feel personal and interactive. Typing “London” sets the whole thing in motion!
- **API Integration**: I connected to the SheCodes Weather API using the `requests` library to fetch real-time weather data. It was a bit tricky at first, but seeing live temperatures pop up felt like magic! ✨
- **Forecast**: I looped through forecast data and used the `datetime` module to format days like “Friday” and “Saturday,” creating a 5-day weather outlook.
- **User Interface**: With the `rich` library, I added colorful text to make the output fun and easy to read—blue for days, purple for my welcome message, and a heart for my credit tag!

### Key Takeaway:
These techniques showed me how Python can pull real-world data and turn it into a useful, interactive tool. Seeing “Today: 24°C” for London after entering the city name was such a rewarding moment! 🌡️

## A Peek at My Creation 💻

Here's a glimpse of my weather app in action—doesn’t it look awesome? Ok, maybe it looks basic for most but I'm so proud of it. 🤣 I built this to display the current temperature and a 5-day forecast, all styled with colorful text. And that little credit tag at the bottom? That’s my proud signature! 😎

## My Certificate of Achievement 📜

I’m beyond excited to share my official **SheCodes Python Basics Certificate**! It’s proof of all the hard work I’ve put into this workshop, and seeing my name, Stephanie Ojinta, on it feels like a huge win. Big thanks to Matt Delac and the SheCodes team for guiding me along the way! 🙌

## Why This Matters for New Coders

Finishing the Python Basics workshop and building this weather app has been a game-changer. It’s proof that with a little practice, you can create something practical and fun—even as a beginner! The SheCodes community and hands-on projects made it so approachable, and that certificate is a milestone I’ll cherish. 💖

## Tips for Aspiring Coders

If you’re thinking about diving into Python or coding in general, here’s my advice:
- **Start with Basics**: A basics Python tutorial is perfect for beginners—try building something small like a weather checker!
- **Play with APIs**: Experiment with free APIs to bring live data into your projects! 
- **Keep It Fun**: Add colors or messages to your output to make coding enjoyable.
- **Celebrate Wins**: Every project you finish is a milestone—give yourself a high-five! 🙌

## What’s Next for Me?

I’m over the moon about completing Python Basics and can’t wait to tackle the next SheCodes workshop Python AI. I'll Learn to build AI-powered applications with Python, APIs, and real-world automation. I’m so pumped to keep growing! 

Let’s keep coding, learning, and building awesome things!  🐍💕

Happy coding! Stephie Oj. 🐍💖
